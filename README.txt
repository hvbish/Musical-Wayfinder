Work on the project was a collaborative effort between both team members. Both participated in brainstorming ideas and continually contributed to refining the focus/scope of the project as it was needed. Both members worked on initial acquisition and cleaning of data from The Sounds of Spotify using the Spotify API. We were both new to D3, and worked to aid the other’s learning throughout the project. Early in the process of building the visualization, Hannah focused on creating basic components and interactivity, while Steven focused more on data scraping from Spotify. Later on, both members worked on adding and improving features of the visualization. Steven continued to work on data scraping and implementing a user login feature, while Hannah focused on developing the design and layout.

One of the most unexpectedly time-consuming aspects of the project for us was the investment required to learn how to use D3, since neither of us had any prior experience with it. We also struggled somewhat with locking on to a clear vision for the project, and came back to this issue several times before agreeing on a more clear and satisfying direction for developing the dashboard (each panel addresses one of the questions we want to answer: Timeline <—> how have my tastes changed over time; Songs scatterplot <—> what trends can be seen in my library; My Genre/All Genres plot <—> how do my tastes fit into the larger world of music?). Part of the difficulty in nailing down our goal for the project was that the streaming history data we initially hoped to use is not made available by Spotify, so we had to regroup and rethink our direction. Ultimately both of us were pleased with what we able to accomplish and the final product we produced.
